title: Why Basic?

Basic is a new kind of database, focusing on privacy, user ownership, and local-first principles.

It creates a Personal Data Store for every end user, allowing applications to request access for reading and writing. Think of it as an open-source, web-wide version of iCloud.

## Problem

Current data storage methods have several issues:

- **Fragmentation**: User data is scattered across numerous apps and platforms
- **Vendor lock-in**: Walled gardens limit user choice and data portability
- **Privacy concerns**: Data breaches and misuse are increasingly common
- **Dependency**: User data relies on third parties, risking loss, censorship, or shutdown

## Objectives

Basic aims to build a more private, collaborative, and user-centric web. Our goals include:

1. **User-owned data**: Users control access and sharing of their data
2. **Interoperable data**: Information flows freely across applications, not siloed in walled gardens
3. **Privacy**: Users can use apps without exposing their data to developers
4. **Open-source protocol**: Fostering a healthy, transparent ecosystem

Additionally, our database should be:

- **Easy to use**: Quick to design, deploy, and integrate into any stack
- **Relational**: Supporting developers' preference for relational and typed models
- **Serverless and scalable**: Automatically adjusting to demand, scaling up or down as needed

# Solution

Basic is a local-first, serverless, relational database designed for user-owned data.

## Traditional vs. Basic Approach

Traditionally, applications create and host databases, storing all user data centrally:

Basic offers an alternative where data is controlled by the user, and applications request access:

## Benefits of User-Owned, Local-First Data

**For Users:**
1. **Data control**: Revoke access or limit permissions at any time
2. **Single source of truth**: Multiple apps can access the same data
3. **Data portability**: Easily transfer data between applications
4. **Offline-first**: Access and modify data without an internet connection

**For Developers:**
1. **Simplified scaling**: Users "bring their own data," reducing server load
2. **Enhanced security**: Sensitive data stays with the user
3. **Easier onboarding**: Import existing user data with less friction
4. **Sync management**: Basic handles data synchronization across devices

## How it works

Basic consists of two main components: Auth and Database.

### Auth

Basic uses standard OAuth2 flow, manageable via API or provided libraries. Users create a single Basic.id account to control all their data and app permissions, streamlining the login process across applications.

### Database

Currently, Basic functions as a document database (similar to Firebase or MongoDB), with support for collections of JSON objects. SQL and relational features are coming soon.

Key differences:
- Separate databases for each user instead of one central database
- Local-first architecture enables offline functionality and automatic syncing
- Data remains under user control, with applications requesting access
