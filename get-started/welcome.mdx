## features and benefits
Basic is a purpose-built backend for personalization of apps and agents. 
We have a federated, "data store per-user" model instead of a traditional database.

Read/write data directly to user data stores with simple SDKs/APIs.
Securely access real-time user-context across existing apps in your users' data stores for personalizing your apps and LLMs.

Basic replaces your primary datastore for the following benefits:
- **Zero infrastructure**: no database to provision — CRUD via SDKs/APIs
- **Share user-context across apps**: real-time read/writes across schemas
- **Built in auth & permissioning**: "multi-tenant" auth with RLS by default
- **Federated, per-user data stores**: portable across apps for deep personalization
- **Instant & offline-first (SDKs only)**: apps with 0 latency apps and offline support

*Features coming soon: multiplayer, federated learning*

## use cases
- **AI apps & agents**: Simple way to store and access user context from previous interactions.
- **AI app/agent builders**: Scale auth and backends for the thousands of apps and agents your users are building.
- **AI wearables**: Store sensitive user information securely and continue improving your models with leaking their data.
- **Embedded AI**: Personalize LLMs for your users with their existing rather than providing a generic, bland experience.
- **Personal/productivity software**: Fit into existing user workflows with bi-directional sync of their existing data. Zero latency and offline support cuts through the noise of your competition. 

## getting started
First, [set up your Basic account](/get-started/adminportal). You've the option to [set up the Basic CLI](/get-started/cli) as well.

Next, choose the right version of the docs based on your technology stack in the top left hand dropdown. These are the ones we support so far:
