Basic replaces your primary datastore:
- **Zero infrastructure**: no database to provision â€” CRUD via SDKs/APIs
- **Share user-context across apps**: real-time read/writes across schemas
- **Built in auth & permissioning**: "multitenant" auth with RLS by default
- **Federated, per-user data stores**: portable across apps for deep personalization
- **Instant & offline-first (SDKs only)**: apps with 0 latency apps and offline support

*Coming soon: multiplayer, federated learning*

**Best for:** AI apps & agents, AI app/agent builders, AI wearables, Embedded AI, personal/productivity software
