## Create your project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    First, install the CLI using your terminal.
    ```bash
    npm i -g @basictech/cli
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login to Basic using the CLI">
    Run `basic login` to create your basic admin account. You will be redirected to a web page to login.
    ```bash
    basic login
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your project">
    Navigate to your project directory and run `basic init` to create your project. You will be prompted to enter a project name, and choose your project stack (Typescript, React, etc.).
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

    ```bash
    basic init
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You now have a new project created. You'll even notice a new `basic.config.ts` / `basic.config.js` file in your project directory with your project ID included!

## Next steps
You can now start building your app!

Otherwise, you can use the [API](/get-started/implement-basic/using-api) for any language.
