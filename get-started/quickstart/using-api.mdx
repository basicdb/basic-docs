# How Basic Auth works
Basic uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.  

Here's a brief overview of how the flow works:

1. The user beings the flow by clicking a "Sign in with Basic" button in your app.
2. Redirect the user to login page, with the appropriate parameters. (see below for the required parameters)
3. The user can login with Basic.id and grants permissions to your app.
4. Basic.id redirects the user back to your app with an authorization code.
5. Your app can exhange the authorization code for an access token and refresh token.
6. Your app can use the access token to make database requests and keep the user logged in.
7. If the access token expires, use the refresh token to get a new access token.

In other words: 

1. Redirect use to `/authorize`
2. User grants access and redirects back to your app with an authorization code
3. Use /token to exchange the code for an access token and refresh token
4. Use the access tokens to make database requests   


# Authentication with the API

<Steps>

    <Step title="Redirect user to /authorize">
        Redirect the user to the login page, with the appropriate parameters.
        
        Redirect URL: 
        `https://api.basic.tech/authorize`   


        ### Required Query Parameters
       <ParamField query="redirect_uri" type="string" default="none" required>
        The URL you want the user to be redirected to after they login.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField query="response_type" type="string" default="code" required>
            The type of response you want to receive. must be `code`.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField query="client_id" type="string" default="none" required>
            Your Basic Project ID.
        </ParamField>
        <ParamField query="scope" type="string" default="profile" required>

        <ParamField query="state" type="string" default="none" required>
            A random string. 
        </ParamField>
    </Step>

    <Step title="User grants access and is redirected back to your app with an authorization code">
        The authorization code will be in the URL as a `code` query parameter.
        For example: 
        `https://your-app.com/callback?code=1234567890`
    </Step>

    <Step title="Exchange the authorization code for an access token and refresh token">
        Make a post request to `/token` with the authorization code in the body. 
        The response will be a JSON object with the access token and refresh token.

        Token URL: 
        `https://api.basic.tech/token`

# Using the database
You can use the REST API to read and write to your database. Checkout the [API Reference](/api-reference/db/get-items) to get started.
