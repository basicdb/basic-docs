          alt="Login / Signup to Basic"
        /> 
    </Step>
  <Step title="Login / Signup with Basic">
    Login with your Basic account. If you don't have one yet, signup to Basic.

  <Step title="Create your project">

          className="block"

          alt="Create your project"
        /> 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your project details">
    Use the form to create a project with a unique name and slug. Make sure not to leave the name or slug fields blank.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/admin-create-project.png"
          alt="Add your project details"
        />

  <Step title="Note your project ID, database URL, and API key (keep this a secret!)">
    You'll need these if you're using the API to connect to your database. Store them securely.

  <Step title="(Optional) You can test everything is working by making a sample fetch request to your database:">

``` js GET Project Details
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", {
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

# Create your schema
<Steps>
<Step title="Create your schema">
    There are two ways to create your schema, either using the table UI, or by using the code editor. Let's explore the table UI first.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/admin-no-schema.png"
          alt="Create your schema"
        /> 
</Step>
<Step title="Add a new table">
    Give your table a unique name, and add fields to it. Fields need to have a unique name within each table, and you can use the dropdown to select the type of each field.
    
    Fields can take on the following types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `json`.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/create-schema-with-ui.png"
          alt="Create a new table"
        /> 
</Step>
<Step title="(Optional) Edit your schema with the code editor">
    You can also edit your schema with the code editor.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/schema-editor.png"
          alt="Edit your schema with the code editor"
        /> 
</Step>
<Step title="Publish your changes">
    Once you've added your tables, you can publish your changes. Upon publishing, you'll notice your version number has been automatically incremented. 

    You may also discard changes if you'd like to revert to the existing version.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/publish-schema-changes.png"
          alt="Publish your changes"
        /> 
</Step>
</Steps>



# Next steps
You can now start building your app! 
If you are using a React app, we recommend you use the [React SDK](/get-started/implement-basic/using-react) to get started.

Otherwise, you can use the [API](/get-started/implement-basic/using-api) for any language.
