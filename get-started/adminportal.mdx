        <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/admin%20logged%20out.png"
          alt="Login / Signup to Basic"
        /> 
    </Step>
  <Step title="Login / Signup with Basic">
    Login with your Basic account. If you don't have one yet, signup to Basic.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/Basic%20SSO.png"
          alt="Login / Signup to Basic"
        /> 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your project">
    After creating your Basic account, head to the Dashboard and create a new project.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/Admin%20no%20projects.png"
          alt="Create your project"
        /> 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your project details">
    Use the form to create a project with a unique name and slug. Make sure not to leave the name or slug fields blank.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/Admin%20create%20project.png"
          alt="Add your project details"
        /> 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage your projects">
    This page allows you to view all your projects and manage them. To view project details, click into any of them.
    <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/Admin%20with%20projects.png"
          alt="Manage your projects"
        /> 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your project ID, database URL, and API key (keep this a secret!)">
    You'll need these if you're using the API to connect to your database. Store them securely.
    <Warning>
        Keep your API Key a secret! Only use it on a secure server environment.
    </Warning>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/API%20key.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) You can test everything is working by making a sample fetch request to your database:">
    Make sure to replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` and `<YOUR_API_KEY>`. 
  
``` js GET Project Details
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", {
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

  </Step>
</Steps>



## Next steps
You can now start building your app! 
If you are using a React app, we recommend you use the [React SDK](/get-started/implement-basic/using-react) to get started.

Otherwise, you can use the [API](/get-started/implement-basic/using-api) for any language.
