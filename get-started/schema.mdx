# Overview
In Basic, we declare schemas in a JSON format as part of the `basic.config.ts` or `basic.config.js` file that lives in your repository. 
It would follow this general format:
<img src="/images/schema.svg" alt="Schema" />

The top level requires three parameters:

### project_id
<ParamField query="project_id" type="string" required>
    This is your project ID, which you can find in the Basic dashboard, or will be auto-generated for you if you had used the [CLI to create your project](/get-started/cli).
</ParamField>

### version
<ParamField query="version" type="int" required>
    This will be used for versioning your schema. It should be an integer that starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each new version. 
    <Note> Versionining of schemas is currently in development. This value should remain at 0.</Note>
</ParamField>

# Tables

Let's double click into the tables to learn how they are declared in the schema.

<img src="/images/SchemaTables.svg" alt="Schema Tables" />

Each table is declared as an object where the key is the table name and the value is an object with the following two parameters:

### type
<ParamField query="type" type="string" required>
    This refers to the type of database table you are creating. At the moment, Basic only supports `collection`, which will operate similarly to MongoDB collections.
</ParamField>

### fields
<ParamField query="fields" type="object" required>
    Fields are the columns of the table. They will be declared as an object of objects. Learn more about the fields below.
</ParamField>

# Fields

<img src="/images/SchemaFields.svg" alt="Schema Fields" />

Each field is declared as an object where the key is the field name and the value is an object with the following 2 parameters:

### type
<ParamField query="type" type="string" required>
    This is the data type of the field. Basic supports the following field types: `string`, `int`, `boolean`, `json`, `text`.
</ParamField>

### indexed
<ParamField query="indexed" type="boolean" required>
    This lets you control if the field should be indexed in the user's client database for local-first benefits. For now, this should always be set to `true`.
</ParamField>

# Example

When put all together, your schema could look like this:


```javascript basic.config.ts
export const schema = {
    project_id: '1234567890',
    version: 0,
    tables: {
        comments: {
            type: 'collection',
            fields: {
                title: { 
                    type: 'string',
                    indexed: true
                },
                body: { 
                    type: 'string',
                    indexed: true
                },
                rating: { 
                    type: 'int',
                    indexed: true
                }
            }
        },
        items: {
            type: 'collection',
            fields: {
                name: { 
                    type: 'string',
                    indexed: true
                },
                quantity: { 
                    type: 'int',
                    indexed: true
                },
                available: {
                    type: 'boolean',
                    indexed: true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
