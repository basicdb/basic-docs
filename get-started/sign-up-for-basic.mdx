## Create your project

<Info>This guide uses the dashboard to manage your project. CLI support is currently in development.</Info>


<Steps>
    <Step title="Login to the Dashboard">
        You can login/signup at https://app.basic.tech
        <img
          className="block"
          src="/images/login.png"
          alt="Login / Signup to Basic"
        /> 
    </Step>
  <Step title="Create your project">
    After creating your account, head to the Dashboard and create a new project using the button on the top right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your project ID, database URL, and API key (keep this a secret!)">
    Your project ID is a public identifier for your project.
    <Warning>
        Keep your API Key a secret! Only use it on a secure server environment.
    </Warning>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/quickstart_1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) You can test everything is working by making a sample fetch request to your database:">
    Make sure to replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` and `<YOUR_API_KEY>`. 
  
``` js GET Project Details
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", {
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

  </Step>
</Steps>



## Next steps
You can now start building your app! 
If you are using a React app, we recommend you use the [React SDK](/get-started/implement-basic/using-react) to get started.

Otherwise, you can use the [API](/get-started/implement-basic/using-api) for any language.
