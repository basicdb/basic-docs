Apps built with Basic SDKs already help you "cache" information so that they can be accessed without internet. 
However, browsers require some final steps to instruct them to load correctly instead of showing the "No Internet" error.

The easiest way is to **copy the following and paste it into your vibecoding tool** (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, v0):

<div 
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    cursor: 'pointer',
    padding: '2rem 1rem',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    transition: 'filter 0.3s ease'
  }}
  onClick={() => {
    const text = `Use the instructions below to turn the existing app into a PWA. Make sure to cache the appropriate pages and icons. Turning a web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) involves several steps to enhance its performance, usability, and offline capabilities. Here's a concise guide on how to do it:

### Steps to Convert a Web App into a PWA

| Step | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **1. Serve over HTTPS** | Ensure your web app is served over HTTPS. PWAs require a secure context. |
| **2. Create a Web App Manifest** | Create a \`manifest.json\` file that provides metadata about your app. This includes the app name, icons, theme color, and start URL. |
| **3. Add a Service Worker** | Implement a service worker to manage caching and enable offline capabilities. This script runs in the background and can intercept network requests. |
| **4. Enable Offline Support** | Use the service worker to cache essential assets and data for offline access. You can use strategies like Cache First or Network First. |
| **5. Responsive Design** | Ensure your app is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes. Use CSS media queries and flexible layouts. |
| **6. Test Performance** | Optimize performance by minimizing load times. Use tools like Lighthouse to audit your PWA and identify areas for improvement. |
| **7. Add PWA Features** | Consider adding additional PWA features like push notifications, background sync, and home screen installation prompts. |
| **8. Regular Updates** | Keep your service worker updated to manage cache effectively and ensure users have access to the latest version of your app. |

### Example of a Manifest File

Here's a simple example of what a \`manifest.json\` file might look like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "short_name": "PWA",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#FFFFFF",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### Example of a Simple Service Worker

Here's a basic example of a service worker that caches files:

\`\`\`javascript
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-cache').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/',
        '/index.html',
        '/styles.css',
        '/script.js',
        '/icon-192x192.png',
        '/icon-512x512.png'
      ]);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
\`\`\`

### Testing Your PWA

After implementing the above steps, you can test your PWA using:

-  **Google Lighthouse**: An auditing tool that can evaluate your PWA's performance and compliance with PWA standards.
-  **Chrome DevTools**: Use the Application panel to inspect the manifest and service worker.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully turn your web app into a Progressive Web App, providing users with a more engaging and reliable experience.`;
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
    alert('Copied PWA instructions to clipboard!');
  }}

  <div style={{
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5',
    filter: 'blur(5px)',
    zIndex: -1
  }} />
  <span style={{ position: 'relative', zIndex: 1 }}>Click to copy PWA instructions</span>
</div>

If you're looking to implement it yourself, here are the main steps:
1. **Create a Web App Manifest**: Create a `manifest.json` file that provides metadata about your app. This includes the app name, icons, theme color, and start URL.
2. **Add a Service Worker**: Implement a service worker to manage caching and enable offline capabilities. This script runs in the background and can intercept network requests.
3. **Enable Offline Support**: Use the service worker to cache essential assets and data for offline access.
