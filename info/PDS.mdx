# Summary

User-owned PDS's are cloud instances that are always under the control of the primary user that is assigned to them. 
While that data may be shared with apps, devices, and other users, the decision to do so is always made by (and can be reverted by) the primary user. 

This is in contrast with prevailing centralized data ownership models.

# Centralized data ownership

Traditionally, an app or website that you use has a centralized data ownership model. Data that gets generated by you - the user - and the data the apps or websites generate, all exist together in a database owned and controlled by the respective service. 

Lets take the example of Google Docs. If you’re typing up a document, you are not only using the interface (application layer) to type and format the document, but also store the data with Google (database layer).

If one day you stop paying for your Google Docs, you will likely not be able to (or limited in the way you can) access your documents. Similarly, if Google decides to shut down Google Docs as a product (perhaps unlikely in the instance of Google Docs, but not unfathomable given their long history of [sunsetting products](https://killedbygoogle.com/)), you will lose your information. 

Sometimes, apps and websites provide you the ability to export this data (CSV, PDF, etc.), but this is largely dependent on the offering. Often, this exporting process is tedious, requires many calls with customer support, or even requires payment. 

Ultimately, the app or website that you’re using often has ownership and control of your data (or at the least, is an intermediary that you have to interact with in order to retrieve, change, or delete your data). 

### Problems with centralized data ownership

This diagram clearly depicts 3 of the problems with this system:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Fragmentation of user data">
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/DataFragmentation.png"
      alt="Data Fragmentation"
    />
    User A's data is spread across multiple databases owned by different apps and websites. The data is also likely to be in different formats, limiting its utility or increasing the complexity of integration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Lack of data control">
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/NoDataControl.png"
      alt="No Data Control"
    />
    User data is only interactable through APIs of the respective services. This approach places reliance on individual services to implement APIs, and to decide what data to share or not. Also, if any of these services were to shut down or if users were to stop paying for them, they'd lose access to their data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bloated backend and database layers">
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/Bloated.png"
      alt="Bloated Backend"
    />
    Apps and websites have larger and more complex backend and database layers because of having to manage data and Auth for all their users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# User-owned Personal Data Stores

Instead of relying on apps and websites to control and own the data that you generate, we believe that you should be the proprietor of your data. 

<Note>
 There are other proposed solutions to this problem like blockchain, P2P, etc. We will discuss tradeoffs in a separate article (coming soon).
</Note>

In it’s essence, a PDS is a cloud instance with an assigned primary user. 
The primary user is the ultimate owner of the data within that instance - they can make all decisions around who the data is shared with, how it can be updated, and will always belong with them. 
They can take that data with them wherever they go.

  alt="Personal Data Store"

<Note>
    The PDS is depicted for an individual. In the case of a business, the PDS would be owned by primary admins, but the same principles would apply.
</Note>

The illustration depicts what a PDS may look like. It would contain data of the primary user like tweets, health records, and photos. The PDS interacts with apps, devices, and other users' PDS's. 

The primary user can initiate or severe connections with any apps, devices, and users at any time. 
Since user data is stored in the PDS instead of being held in the respective apps or websites, you may interface with your data across multiple apps and devices interchangeably - imagine typing up the first half of a document in Google Docs, and finishing it up in Microsoft Word.

### User-owned PDS's as a bedrock for data operations

User owned PDS's provide 3 major benefits:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consolidation of user data">
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/ConsolidationOfData.png"
      alt="Consolidation of Data"
    />
    Rather than your data being fragmented across all the different apps and websites you use, it remains in a single space that can be queried (in the Google Docs example, all the words that you type up on the document is stored in your PDS). 
    Developers will read and write data to your PDS for all the data that pertains to you. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Control and ownership of your data">
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/ControlOfData.png"
      alt="Control and Ownership of Data"
    />
    Your data remains in your PDS irrespective of the apps or websites you use. It belongs to you forever, and will be available for use with any future services. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Simplified applications">
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/SimpleApps.png"
      alt="Simplification of Applications"
    />
    Apps and websites can be developed with a much simpler architectures since they no longer need to own or manage user data. Basic provides the option for apps without backend and database layers so that they can focus on building a better user experience.
  </Step>

*It is important to understand that we aren’t referring to **centralized** **data storage** (i.e., how the data is stored in a monolithic or centralized database vs. a distributed database).*

*Rather, we’re referring to who has “ownership” and control of the data.*
