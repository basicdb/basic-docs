All APIs use the bearer token authentication method. To authenticate with the API, you need to include the `Authorization` header in your request with the value `Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>`.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>'
```

## API Tokens

You can find your API token in your project dashboard.

The API token is a secret key that should be kept confidential. Do not share your API token in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on.
