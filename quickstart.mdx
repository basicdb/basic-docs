## Create your project



<Info>This guide uses the dashboard to manage your project - an API and CLI are in progress.</Info>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your project">
    After creating your account, head to the Dashboard and create a new project using the button on the top right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your project ID, database URL, and API key (keep this a secret!)">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/quickstart_1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="You can test everything is working by making a sample fetch request to your database:">
    Make sure to replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` and `<YOUR_API_KEY>`. 
  
``` js GET Project Details
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>", {
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

 
{/* <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.

</AccordionGroup> */}

## Create your database

{/* Great, now that your project is all setup, its time to start adding data.  */}

<Info> Databases on Basic are currently document collections, similar to MongoDB or Firebase.  Support for SQL databases is coming soon! </Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go the Data tab, and create a new table.">
  </Step>
  <Step title="You can now query all the documents within it ">

    
      ``` js GET database table
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/db/<TABLE_NAME>", {
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
Since we don’t have any documents created yet, this should return an empty array. 

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your first document">

        ``` js POST add item
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/db/<TABLE_NAME>", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "hello": "world"
  })
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
    
    If we retry the query from step 2, you should now see your document!

  </Step>

 <Step title="Update the document">
 Let’s update the document now. We’ll provide a document ID, and some additional data we want to store. By default, this will merge the data, instead of replacing it.

        ``` js POST update item
fetch("https://api.basic.tech/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/db/<TABLE_NAME>", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "sup": "universe"
  })
}).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

  </Step>

  
</Steps>


## Next steps
You can now start building your app! Create tables, add items, and query to your hearts content.

<Info>
In this limited preview, you are only able to store data for your own account. Support for adding additional users to your app coming soon.
