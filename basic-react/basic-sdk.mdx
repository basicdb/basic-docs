title: "Integrate React SDK"
description: "Using the @basictech/react library with your React project"
---
In this guide, you will:
1. Install the Basic React SDK to a new / existing React project to enable local-first sync
2. Connect to a Basic project and customize the schema
3. Add sign in and sign out functionality

<Info> This library is only for client-side React. A NextJS library is coming soon! </Info>


# Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new React project">
    If you don't have one already, create a new React project:
    ```bash Terminal
    # create a new vite project:
    npm create vite@latest
    ```
    When prompted in the CLI, enter `y` for installing the vite package. 
    Then give your project a name. Choose React as your framework. 
    And finally choose the TypeScript variant.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the @basictech/react library">
    `cd project-name` into your project, run `npm i` and install the `@basictech/react` library in your app:

    ```bash Terminal
    # first, cd into your project
    cd project-name

    # then, install all packages
    npm i
    
    # finally, install Basic
    npm install @basictech/react
    ```
  </Step>
  </Steps>

# Set up basic.config
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a basic.config.ts file">
    Create a new file called `basic.config.ts` in the root of your project. You can either do this manually, or go through the [CLI](/get-started/cli) flow to have it automatically created for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the config">
    Add your project ID to the `basic.config.ts` file, and customize the schema in the file. You can copy your schema from the [Basic dashboard](/get-started/adminportal#create-your-schema) and paste it into the file.

    Any changes you make to the schema in basic.config need to eventually be deployed to the Basic dashboard. Local changes would be for development purposes only.
    ```ts basic.config.ts
    export const schema = {
      project_id: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
      version: 0,
      tables: {
        table_name: {
          type: 'collection',
          fields: {
            field_name: {
              type: 'string',
              indexed: true,
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Adding Auth
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the BasicProvider to main.tsx">
    Navigate to `src/main.tsx`, add the BasicProvider to imports, and wrap your app in it.
    <Info>Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your Project ID from the Basic dashboard. To create one, follow the instructions for [signing up](/get-started/adminportal).</Info>
    ```tsx main.tsx
    // add the BasicProvider to your existing imports
    import { BasicProvider } from '@basictech/react'
    import { schema } from '../basic.config'

    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <StrictMode>
        {/* Wrap your app in BasicProvider, including the project ID and schema */}
        <BasicProvider project_id={schema.project_id} schema={schema}>
          <App />
        </BasicProvider>
      </StrictMode>,
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a login button to App.tsx">
    Now navigate to  `src/App.tsx` and import `signin`, `isSignedIn`, and `user`. Vite comes with some template code, but you can replace the contents with the following:
    ```tsx App.tsx
    import { useBasic } from '@basictech/react'
    import './App.css'

    function App() {
      // Import signin to enable the user to sign in
      // Import isSignedIn to check if the user is signed in
      // Import user to get the user's information once they're signed in
      const { signin, isSignedIn, user } = useBasic()

      return (
        <>
          {/* if the user isn't signed in, show the sign in button */}
          {!isSignedIn ? (
            <button onClick={signin}>Sign In</button>
          ) : (
            // once signed in, show their email
            <div>
              <p>Signed in as: {user?.email}</p>
            </div>
          )}
        </>
      )
    }

    export default App
    ```
    
    Let's test it out! Clicking on the button should now redirect you to the [Basic.id](http://Basic.id) page where your users can login or create an account.
    Once they're done, they'll be redirected back to your app and see their email displayed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a logout button">
    Use the isSignedIn hook to check if the user is logged in, and the signout function to sign out the user:
    ```tsx App.tsx
    import { useBasic } from '@basictech/react'
    import './App.css'

    function App() {
      // Add signout to the imports
      const { signin, isSignedIn, user, signout } = useBasic()

      return (
        <>
          {isSignedIn ? (
            <div>
              <p>Signed in as: {user.email}</p>
              {/* Add a button to sign out */}
              <button onClick={signout}>Sign Out</button>
            </div>
          ) : (
            <button onClick={signin}>Sign In</button>
          )}
        </>
      )
    }

    export default App
    ```
    That's it! You've successfully added Basic Auth to your React app ðŸŽ‰
  </Step>

# Using the database
You can use the React SDK to read and write to the user's database. Checkout the [React SDK docs](/sdk-reference/react-components) to get started.
