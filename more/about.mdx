Basic is a new kind of database, with a focus on privacy, user ownership, and local-first. 

It works by create a database for every end user - a Personal Data Store - and then lets applications request access to read & write to it.
Its a bit like iCloud - but open source and for the entire web.

## Building on Basic - how it works
For the most part, you can use Basic as you would a regular database, with additional benefits. There two main components: Auth and Database.

### Auth
Auth is pretty straightforward -  you can use the API to initiate an OAuth flow, or use the built in SDKs. The main difference is that instead of having a seperate account for every app - users create a single Basic.id account, where they can control all of their data and apps. 

### Database
Probably the main thing to note is that instead of one massive database where you store all of your users data, Basic instead has seperate databases for every user.



## The Vision
The goals of Basic are to: 
- user-owned data : users should be able to control who has access to their data, and what they share.
- interoperable data : users should be able to use any app, on any device, and have all their data available to them. 
- privacy : users should be able to use apps without giving developers read access to their data. 
- open source protocol : all of it should be open, creating a healthy, open ecosystem
